</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Final the best feeling to get. I have always tried to be true atleast to myself. Now I don't really expect anything from this world. The random particles that exist in this world and it shows that God doesn't care about us. And that randomness is the thing that is that subconscious that we have. At the bottom we have this burden on us to experience whatever we like and that is what matters. The biggest mistake one can made is think it's all a fair game and it isn't. Peterson says its so bad at that level and that is what it gets me. 
<em>I don't really f care whatever you think and I finally would let you go. Let's have a good life in all its way</em>
Currently writing this above 20k sea-level so that can be the motivation and the feeedom for this. But seriously this was the last and the final strike I needed. Who cares if I don't get the documents write. Let it be how the level is. I felt really great leaving home. The feeling I am experiencing the first time. Seriously humbled. Now I understand how he must have felt when he was out there all alone. That's very brave in my eyes and you are seriously one of the fews. The circle now closes. Thanx TCS for this. Good experience comes at price so I will have to peace to myself and let him be him.  </p>
