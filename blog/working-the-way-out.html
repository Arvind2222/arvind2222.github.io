</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>You try to fool me. I only ignore if it doesn't have any implied actions on me. You can fool how ever you want but remember it's not something I would do. Not even once you tried saying you are wrong or you're sorry. This is not done. Whatever impressions you have of others it doesn't work with me. I have seen how you behave with others and I am experienced enough to know where you you will play. It's serious so sickening to see that some of the moments are genuine and real but the others are so superficya and you try to play naive. I told in the beginning I won't be paying for anything. The khichadi I ate was only because the waiter served me. When I was serving you all I didn't take myself so it's clear I wasn't clearly interested in the thing. Thing is when something gets good native or too close it become worthless. And that's what happened between Aditya and me. I can see why he became to  detestable to me. These little quirks. When someone is vulnerable not playing for them. I seriously took you to the Hardwell party instead of my only friend Aditya. So that's something I will always be guilty of. And you sob got your own ticket. Like seriously. He is making music and religiously follows it. And I took you. Should have considered my options. But now I will. 
I was your secondary option but to him I was his only option. And this is not done. </p>
<h2>Dunkirk</h2>
<p>I saw the movie Dunkirk with my friend Sumit. Now it's your birthday. You invite everyone of your friends on your birthday. We watch the movie and go to sids house for after party discussion. And you called me <strong>makar</strong> for having seen the movie before. I will never forget this my entire life. You were short on tickets and now it's my fault for coming to an invited movie and how well you put it. <em>you should have told me you have watched the movie earlier</em>
Seriously! Why, why should I tell you. If you don't want me to come to your movie don't invite me. 
You have to hide you shortcomings on calling it on me. You couldn't afford the ticket so you want me to take the responsibility of it. 
Even if someone have had the lunch of his life and got invited to a party, it's upto him to whether to come or not
 It's your birthday and not his. Your function and not his. Your treat not his. Why should I reject the offer when I have a strong reason for it
From then on I conclude all people of this age are cunning and smart. You are the prime example of it. Whenever you have to bear the burden you want to lay it out on me and that's just because I bought you a pasta instead of giving you your 100rs. Well played sir. I thought it was all transparent and sharing. 
All bad things have happened to me because of you and I still don't consider it. This is the first time I am even writing about it.
