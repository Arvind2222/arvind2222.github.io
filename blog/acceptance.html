</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Why sometimes we always hate ourselves and why sometimes we love ourselves. Why the frames of those distant cliffs from comfortable bed- rooms implies surge of adventures. Why being present at the moment is lauded regularly. So much. 
I believe at times chaotic thoughts are crucial. Maybe even necessary. The concurrent moment presents the vibes phony. The detestable feelings that accompanies after knowing a person too well. Even knowledge of the fact that there’s no point in all the chaos that presents itself at anytime doesn’t helps. That what you are will never be what you want. You are your share. However high those smokes rises or bright that wick gets. It dies. You are your wicked smiles and those surreal smirks. 
You are told to walk with purpose. Sometimes it makes sense to tip toe the flanks. It make sense to accept those flaws rather essential. To live peacefully with oneself is the best feeling to live for. Smooth and placid for what you are. What you were. What you will be. Its all part of you. Live while you still can. ’Coz those wildflowers are those little part that makes the whole as Gogh said </p>
