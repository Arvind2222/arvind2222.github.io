</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Most of them are substandard they don’t even know. Standing in line for 2 hours to get a coffee for 100, a 100 store offer which meant a discount of 90 created a huge impact. It made me realise how <em>monetary values stand against people. Even myself. I am frugal and miser at the same time. Some of my friends even call me cheap. Sometimes these are running statements and others it’s just their way of telling they know me better.</em>
Sometimes I just cannot understand my urge to spend money on anything. Any normal thing that I won’t be using in my entire life. Like for real. And that feeling is very real. I don’t know what it would take to not feel that. But for every now and then, whenever I go out alone or even with someone, it feels for me as if a person is there watching me, judging me. Observing Every action I take carefully, every dime I spend. It feel like the person used to be a part of me, and now he does not talk to me. It does lets me forget the importance of some 10rs or how I used to crave for my possession.
You see I have my priorities. I love playing chess. I go for snooker classes, I love my cue that costs me around 2000. I want badminton play to be crisp, The racket alone costs 4000, leave the endless shuttles one has to buy. Yet I am obsessed with running, like a ritual. My shoes are never below 3000. All fine and in great quality till now. To be simpler here, I feel they are my responsibility. They exist because of me and starving them and getting a lavish dinner is never how it should work and it never aligns with my think- ing. This is what I feel. Plain and simple.
Whenever I buy something that’s not necessary, the feeling eats me inside. And when I get something for the ones lurking inside me, it feels like the best feeling in the world. People say get an experience, Travel places and get past yourself. It will be like a well for you, never ending happiness. In my opinion spending on experience is good but mastering those Little things you like then and now. It will surpass any travel experience in the world. Getting that a4 knight to the g7 square and punishing your opponent mistake by potting all those red or better yet surpassing them all like a man who has stamina like quiver of arrows. The arrows that blunts through the air like that hot knife through the butter. Smooth and free.
Travelling to places is great, that pristine feeling of existence in the tiniest places. Feeling that we are all humans after all. Ground reality always comes from travelling places and places. Places that makes your feel comfortable getting uncomfortable. But believe me the change you make in yourself after getting a mastery or even near mastery level is something you will never forget your entire life.
In my view all the activities I mentioned , I find them an investments. An upgrade, a better version of my existing self. Getting an upgrade for a device that 19 years old is huge thing in my world. You see there just no limit for the version. You don’t even have dependence on others. Just go out get one of the latest ones and move for the next ones. Just like that you are the best of all your past. and Its the best feeling ever. Improving an inch a day and then it looks like a entire country from another world landscape. Its an active process, requires will and hard work and not just getting to some place, like sitting in a lecture, getting fed all the information all the unnecessary things and spitting it all out here in the form of photos and memoirs and the day comes you are on the wheel chair beside that fireplace. Just to know that it doesn’t even matters now.
For this reason, getting a coffee doesn’t feels bad whereas spending on that samosa just makes me doubt my existence. Substitutes don’t get the preference, get over it. All the pleasure that does not counts and are on the other side are substitute to me. And I don’t want to adulterate. Let’s see how it unfolds for me. Maybe it’s not, may be it is. But you know what, I don’t even care. It’s a memoir from myself to arvind. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So lets get busy with something we love. And you will be proud of yourself one day. 
Till then be <strong>consistent and be trying</strong>. That all you got.</p>
